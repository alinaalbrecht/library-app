# library App

Add books to your library, mark them as read or delete them if you wish. The list of books is saved to your browser's local storage.

The app is fully keyboard accessible and features JavaScript form validation, as well as custom focus styling.

You can create your own book collection [here](https://alinaalbrecht.github.io/library-app/).
